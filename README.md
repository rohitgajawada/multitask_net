Multitask Tracking

TODO:
1) Scale coordinates to corresponding value after resize
2) Try training network

Possible modifications:
1) regress offsets, not coordinates

To keep in mind and other ideas:
1) attention based on previous frame in the form of gaussians
2) occlusion network
3) motion network
